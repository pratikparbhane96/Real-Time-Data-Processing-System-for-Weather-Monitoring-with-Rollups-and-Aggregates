# Project Title
Real-Time-Data-Processing-System-for-Weather-Monitoring-with-Rollups-and-Aggregates
## Description

### Overview
The Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring is designed to continuously retrieve, process, and analyze weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. This system focuses on providing daily weather summaries, including average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, as well as generating alerts based on user-defined thresholds. 

### Key Features
- **Real-Time Data Retrieval**: The system fetches current weather conditions and forecasts for specified locations using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Historical Data Aggregation**: It collects and aggregates weather data over a defined period, allowing for rollups that summarize key metrics such as temperature variations, humidity levels, and wind conditions.
- **Alert System**: Users can set temperature thresholds, and the system will notify them if the recorded temperature exceeds these thresholds, helping them stay informed about extreme weather conditions.
- **Data Visualization**: The application presents weather data in a user-friendly format, including graphical representations of temperature trends and weather conditions.

### Technical Implementation
- **Architecture**: The application is built using a client-server architecture, where the client interface allows users to input their location and view weather data, while the server processes API calls and manages data storage.
- **Containerization**: The system is designed to run in Docker or Podman containers, facilitating easy deployment and scalability. This setup ensures that all necessary dependencies, including the web server and database, are contained within isolated environments.
- **Dependencies**: The project relies on several libraries and frameworks for data processing, visualization, and API interaction. A comprehensive list of dependencies and installation instructions will be included in the documentation.

### Use Cases
- **Individuals**: Users can monitor their local weather conditions and receive alerts for extreme temperatures.
- **Businesses**: Organizations can utilize the aggregated weather data to inform operational decisions, such as staffing and logistics, based on weather conditions.

## Design Choices

### Design Choices for the Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring

1. **Client-Server Architecture**:
   - **Rationale**: This architecture separates the user interface (client) from the data processing (server), enhancing scalability and maintainability. It allows for easier updates to either side without impacting the other.

2. **Use of APIs**:
   - **Rationale**: Leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather data ensures access to reliable and updated information without the need for extensive data collection infrastructure. This approach saves development time and costs.

3. **Docker Containers**:
   - **Rationale**: Containerization using Docker provides a consistent environment for the application, simplifying deployment and reducing compatibility issues. It allows the application to run in isolation, ensuring that dependencies do not conflict with other applications.

4. **Data Aggregation and Rollups**:
   - **Rationale**: Implementing rollups and aggregates enhances performance by summarizing large datasets, allowing for quick retrieval of relevant information. This is crucial for real-time applications where speed is essential.

5. **Real-Time Data Processing**:
   - **Rationale**: The system continuously retrieves and processes weather data, providing timely updates to users. This is critical for applications that depend on current weather conditions, such as alert systems for extreme weather.

6. **User Interface Design**:
   - **Rationale**: A user-friendly interface ensures that users can easily interact with the system, view weather data, and receive alerts. This enhances user engagement and satisfaction.

7. **Database Selection**:
   - **Rationale**: Choosing a lightweight database (like SQLite or a NoSQL solution) for storing historical weather data allows for efficient data retrieval and minimizes overhead. It is well-suited for applications that require quick access to data without complex querying.

8. **Temperature Alerts**:
   - **Rationale**: Implementing a temperature threshold alert system enhances user safety by notifying them of extreme weather conditions. This feature emphasizes the application's utility in everyday decision-making.

9. **Modular Code Structure**:
   - **Rationale**: Organizing the code into modules improves readability and maintainability. It allows for easier testing and debugging, making it simpler to enhance features or fix issues over time.

These design choices collectively create a robust, efficient, and user-friendly system for monitoring weather data in real-time.

## Dependencies

List the main dependencies required for setting up and running your application, for example:

- **Web Server**: Nginx or Apache (included in the Docker image).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MySQL (can be set up using Docker containers).
- **Other Dependencies**: List any additional libraries or tools your project depends on.
